NVIC0094	DB06263	0.2	"Myelosuppression, with the primary clinical manifestation of neutropenia and leucopenia, is the dose-limiting toxicity of this drug. In addition to this, mucositis, nausea, vomiting, and alopecia are frequent. Hepatopathy, observed with elevated bilirubin concentrations, occurs less frequently. Cardiotoxicity is a major adverse effect of the anthracycline antibiotics and may be acute or chronic; in the acute setting, electrocardiographic (ECG) abnormalities may be observed, demonstrating ST-T elevations and arrhythmias, however, chronic cardiotoxicity poses a serious risk that may be lethal due to the slow development of irreversible, cardiomyopathy. The occurrence of toxicity shows a significant interindividual variation, and for this reason, the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of anthracyclines have been heavily investigated in order to identify models that may be used in the clinical setting to prevent the development of serious toxicity, mainly leucopenia, and maximize tumor exposure. Interestingly, a recent study was done to further examine genetic predisposition neutropenia/amrubicin toxicity. It was determined that C3435T polymorphisms of the ABCB1 gene might be able to predict severe amrubicin-induced neutropenia.Secondary alcohol metabolites of earlier generation anthracyclines have been shown to lead to cardiac toxicity which is a major toxicity of conventional anthracyclines and thus limits the amount that can be delivered safely to patients. Clinical manifestations of toxicity observed on the acute and repeated administration of amrubicin in rats and dogs were dose-related and reversible including fecal changes (mucoid or bloody feces/diarrhea), body weight decreases, decreased food consumption, decreased activity, and alopecia.
